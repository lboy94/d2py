### Features: ###
  * modular scripts: should be easy to modify and expand even for newcomers to programming
  * multitasking capability: can be assigned tasks of different priorities, allowing for complex behaviors
  * thin core: interface between bot and D2 is through a simple API which can be re-implemented using different methods (this should make it easier to implement anti-detection)
  * open source: I hope that once the ball gets rolling, others will contribute
