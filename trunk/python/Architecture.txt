Important files and directories:

d2py.py		First file run by engine when DLL is injected into D2. At that
	point, standard input and output aren't bound and there's no way for
	Python scripts to give output to the user. This script opens up a
	console so output can be displayed, then passes control to run.py

startup.py	Further initializes the bot, gets it into a state where
	modules can be loaded and run.

taskman.py	Task master that queues and runs tasks according to priority,
	using their built-in yield statements to do the multitasking. Should
	also collect some timing info, finding average and maximum uninterrupted
	runtimes for tasks and flagging worst offenders.
		Is responsible for propagating exceptions throughout task stacks
	so errors like game drops/realm downs can properly reroute control 
	logic.

core/*.py	This isn't a module directory and these aren't actual modules.
	They're mere documentation of built-in functions provided by d2py.dll
	when it starts the interpreter. An alternate implementation could 
	actually use these as modules, but this is the way it's currently done.

modules/*.py	Here, the scripts that control the bot are placed. The
	requirements and suggestions for how script functions are probably in
	taskman.py
